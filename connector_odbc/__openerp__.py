Import data from other databases using connector framework.

Synchronize data from odbc compatible database source.
You will find in tests folder a sample of implementation.

Under the sample folder you will find sample
demonstrating the most common use cases.

When importing hierarchical data do not forget to
manage `defer_parent_store_computation` in context.

There is an open issue with the management of the
priority in connector.
When using delayed import, if you have a task with a high priority
that generates a lot job it may prevent task with lower priority to be imported
