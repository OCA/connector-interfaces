Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* with the import of standard Odoo CSV files, a concurrency error occurs
  when updating the `report_data` of `import_recordset` table (from the
  importer: `self._do_report()` -> `self.recordset.set_report(...)`).
  The job is automatically retried a second time (without concurrency errors).
  For small files it's not a big issue, but for files with a huge amount of
  lines it takes time to process them two times.
