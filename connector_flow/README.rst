Connector-Flow
===========

This module provides a minimal framework for common
data import/export tasks based on the OpenERP Connector. Tasks like parsing
and writing a CSV file or uploading a file to an FTP server can be chained
into task flows.

At the moment every flow must a have a unique start. One task can trigger
several tasks.

The module adds a new menu item "Import/Export" under the Connector top-level
menu where tasks and task flows can be configured. Tasks can be run from
the "Run Task" wizard. If a task needs a file as input, a file can be uploaded
in the wizard.

The *connector_flow_example_{ftp,product}* modules provide pre-configured
demo flows.

This module was definitely inspired by the works of Akretion (file_repository)
and Camptocamp (connector_file).
